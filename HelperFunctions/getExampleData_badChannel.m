function getExampleData_badChannel(target_folder)
% GETEXAMPLEDATA_BADCHANNEL Downloads hardcoded files into a target folder,
% automatically extracting ZIP archives.
%
% This function iterates through a hardcoded structure of URLs and 
% corresponding filenames. For each entry, it checks if the file already 
% exists in the target folder. If it does not exist, the file is downloaded 
% using websave. If the downloaded file is a .zip archive, it is
% automatically extracted and the archive is deleted.
%
% INPUTS:
%   target_folder - A string specifying the path to the directory where
%                   the files should be saved. This folder MUST exist, 
%                   otherwise the function will throw an error.
%
% Example Usage:
%
%   % 1. Define the download location (and ensure it exists)
%   download_path = 'MyStanfordData'; 
%
%   % 2. Run the function
%   getExampleData_badChannel(download_path);
