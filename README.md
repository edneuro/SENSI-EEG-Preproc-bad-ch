# SENSI EEG Preproc — Bad Channel Detection Module

This repository contains a MATLAB module for semi-automated EEG bad-channel detection with an interactive review UI. The main entry point is `markSusChs.m`.

This introduces a MATLAB Module for bad-channel quality control that emphasizes interpretability, relational structure, and human-in-the-loop validation rather than fully automated rejection. The method operates on multi-channel EEG data and combines complementary channel-level features, including time-dependent neighbor dissimilarity and amplitude- and variance-based statistics to score and pre-label channels as good, suspicious, or bad. To expose shared artifactual structure, channels are additionally grouped using a similarity measure derived from the co-occurrence of robustly detected high-amplitude transients, allowing channels to be reviewed together. Importantly, clustering is used as an exploratory tool to reveal co-artifactual patterns rather than to impose final class labels, which are confirmed through an interactive review interface supported by summary visualizations and grouped channel displays. 

## Example data

Example (deidentified) EEG data used by `example.m` are hosted on the Stanford Digital Repository (SDR):

**Data location:**  
https://purl.stanford.edu/dg856vy8753

The `example.m` script downloads the data files from the SDR URLs into the local `ExampleData/` directory and then runs a demonstration analysis using `markSusChs.m`.

For full details about the dataset contents (file descriptions, variables, and notes), see the dataset README provided inside the `ExampleData` folder, or at the SDR link above.

## Quick start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open MATLAB and add the repository (and subfolders) to your path.
3. Run: example.m
